        <p>If AWS CloudFormation fails to create, update, or delete your stack, you can view error messages or
            logs to help you learn more about the issue. The following tasks describe general
            methods for troubleshooting a CloudFormation issue. For information about specific errors and
            solutions, see the <a href="#troubleshooting-errors">Troubleshooting errors</a> section.</p>

                        console</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> to view the status of your stack. In the console, you can
                    view a list of stack events while your stack is being created, updated, or
                    deleted. From this list, find the failure event and then view the status reason
                    for that event. The status reason might contain an error message from AWS CloudFormation or
                    from a particular service that can help you troubleshoot your problem. For more
                    information about viewing stack events, see <a href="./cfn-console-view-stack-data-resources.html">Viewing AWS CloudFormation stack data and resources on the

                <p>For Amazon EC2 issues, view the cloud-init and cfn logs. These logs are published
                    on the Amazon EC2 instance in the <code>/var/log/</code> directory. These
                    logs capture processes and command outputs while AWS CloudFormation is setting up your
                    instance. For Windows, view the EC2Configure service in
                    <code>%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService</code>, EC2 Launch in

                <p>You can also configure your AWS CloudFormation template so that the logs are published to
                    Amazon CloudWatch, which displays logs in the AWS Management Console so you don't have to connect to
                    your Amazon EC2 instance.

            <p>To resolve this situation, try the following:</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
                 
                 
                 
                 
                     
            <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
                    <p>Some resources must be empty before they can be deleted. For example, you
                        must delete all objects in an Amazon S3 bucket or remove all instances in an
                        Amazon EC2 security group before you can delete the bucket or security
                        group.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>Ensure that you have the necessary IAM permissions to delete the
                        resources in the stack. In addition to AWS CloudFormation permissions, you must be
                        allowed to use the underlying services, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon EC2.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>When stacks are in the <code class="code">DELETE_FAILED</code> state because AWS CloudFormation
                        couldn't delete a resource, rerun the deletion with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteStack.html"><code class="code">RetainResources</code></a> parameter and specify the resource
                        that AWS CloudFormation can't delete. AWS CloudFormation deletes the stack without deleting the
                        retained resource. Retaining resources is useful when you can't delete a
                        resource, such as an S3 bucket that contains objects that you want to keep,
                        but you still want to delete the stack.</p>
                    <p>After you delete the stack, you can manually delete retained resources by
                        using their associated AWS service.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>You can't delete stacks that have termination protection enabled. If you
                        attempt to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the deletion
                        fails and the stack--including its status--remains unchanged. Disable
                        termination protection on the stack, then perform the delete operation
                        again.</p>
                    <p>This includes <a href="./using-cfn-nested-stacks.html">nested stacks</a>

                        termination protection on the root stack, then perform the delete operation
                        again. It's strongly recommended that you don't delete nested stacks
                        directly, but only delete them as part of deleting the root stack and all
                        its resources.</p>

            <h3 id="troubleshooting-errors-dependency-error">Dependency error</h3>

            <p>To resolve a dependency error, add a <code class="code">DependsOn</code> attribute to resources
                that depend on other resources in your template. In some cases, you must explicitly
                declare dependencies so that AWS CloudFormation can create or delete resources in the correct
                order. For example, if you create an Elastic IP and a VPC with an Internet gateway
                in the same stack, the Elastic IP must depend on the Internet gateway attachment.
                For additional information, see <a href="./aws-attribute-dependson.html">DependsOn attribute</a>.</p>
         
         
            <h3 id="troubleshooting-errors-error-parsing-parameter-when-passing-a-list">Error parsing parameter when passing a list</h3>

            <p>When you use the AWS Command Line Interface or AWS CloudFormation to pass in a list, add the escape character
                    (<code class="code">\</code>) before each comma. The following sample shows how you specify
                an input parameter when using the
                AWS CLI.</p>
         <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="text ">ParameterKey=CIDR,ParameterValue='10.10.0.0/16\,10.10.0.0/24\,10.10.1.0/24'</code></pre>
         
         
            <h3 id="troubleshooting-errors-insufficient-iam-permissions">Insufficient
                    IAM permissions</h3>

            <p>When you work with an AWS CloudFormation stack, you not only need permissions to use AWS CloudFormation, you
                must also have permission to use the underlying services that are described in your
                template. For example, if you're creating an Amazon S3 bucket or starting an Amazon EC2
                instance, you need permissions to Amazon S3 or Amazon EC2. Review your IAM policy and verify
                that you have the necessary permissions before you work with AWS CloudFormation stacks. For more
                information see, <a href="./using-iam-template.html">Controlling access with AWS Identity and Access Management</a>.</p>
         
         
            <h3 id="troubleshooting-errors-invalid-value-or-unsupported-resource-property">Invalid value or unsupported resource property</h3>

            <p>When you create or update an AWS CloudFormation stack, your stack can fail due to invalid input
                parameters, unsupported resource property names, or unsupported resource property
                values. For input parameters, verify that the resource exists. For example, when you
                specify an Amazon EC2 key pair or VPC ID, the resource must exist in your account and in
                the region in which you are creating or updating your stack. You can use
                AWS-specific <a href="./parameters-section-structure.html#parameters-section-structure-syntax">parameter
                    types</a> to ensure that you use valid values.</p>
            <p>For resource property names and values, update your template to use valid names
                and values. For a list of all the resources and their property names, see <a href="./aws-template-resource-type-ref.html">AWS resource and property types reference</a>.</p>
         
         
            <h3 id="troubleshooting-errors-limit-exceeded">Quota exceeded</h3>

            <p>Verify that you didn't reach a resource quota. For example, the default maximum
                number of Amazon EC2 On-Demand instances that you can launch is 5. If try to create more
                Amazon EC2 On-Demand instances than your account quota, the instance creation fails and
                you receive the error <code class="code">Status=start_failed</code>. To view the default AWS

            <p>A nested stack failed to roll back. Because of potential resource dependencies
                between nested stacks, AWS CloudFormation doesn't start cleaning up nested stack resources until
                all nested stacks have been updated or have rolled back. When a nested stack fails
                to roll back, AWS CloudFormation cancels all operations, regardless of the state that the other
                nested stacks are in. A nested stack that completed updating or rolling back but
                didn't receive a signal from AWS CloudFormation to start cleaning up because another nested
                failed to roll back is in an <code class="code">UPDATE_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS</code> or
                    <code class="code">UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS</code> state. A nested stack
                that failed to update but didn't receive a signal to start rolling back is in an
                    <code class="code">UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS</code> state.</p>
            <p>A nested stack might fail to roll back because of changes that were made outside
                of AWS CloudFormation, when the stack template doesn't accurately reflect the state of the stack.
                A nested stack might also fail if an Auto Scaling group in a nested stack had an
                insufficient resource signal timeout period when the group was created or
                updated.</p>

            <p>Operations for these resources might take longer than the default timeout period.
                The timeout period depends on the resource and credentials that you use. To extend

                fail (<code class="code">UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</code> state). For example, you might have a
                stack that's rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of
                AWS CloudFormation. Because AWS CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the

            <p>Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually fix the error and continue

            <h3 id="troubleshooting-errors-resource-removed-not-deleted">Resource
                    removed from stack but not deleted</h3>
            <p>During a stack update, CloudFormation has removed a resource from a stack but not
                deleted the resource. The resource still exists, but is no longer accessible through
                CloudFormation. This may occur during stack updates where:</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
                 
                 
            <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
                    <p>CloudFormation needs to replace an existing resource, so it first creates a
                        new resource, then attempts to delete the old resource.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>You have removed the resource from the stack template, so CloudFormation
                        attempts to delete the resource from the stack.</p>
                </li></ul></div>
            <p>However, there may be cases where CloudFormation can't delete the resource. For
                example, if the user doesn't have permissions to delete a resource of a given
                type.</p>
            <p>CloudFormation attempts to delete the old resource three times. If CloudFormation can't
                delete the old resource, it removes the old resource from the stack and continues
                updating the stack. When the stack update is complete, CloudFormation issues an
                    <code class="code">UPDATE_COMPLETE</code> stack event, but includes a
                    <code class="code">StatusReason</code> that states that one or more resources couldn't be
                deleted. CloudFormation also issues a <code class="code">DELETE_FAILED</code> event for the specific
                resource, with a corresponding <code class="code">StatusReason</code> providing more detail on
                why CloudFormation failed to delete the resource.</p>
            <p>To resolve this situation, delete the resource directly using the console or API
                for the underlying service.</p>
