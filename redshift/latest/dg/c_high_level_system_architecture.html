            <b>Client applications</b>
        </p><p>Amazon Redshift integrates with various data loading and ETL (extract, transform, and load)
            tools and business intelligence (BI) reporting, data mining, and analytics tools.
            Amazon Redshift is based on  open standard PostgreSQL, so most existing SQL client applications
            will work with only minimal changes. For information about important differences between
            Amazon Redshift SQL and PostgreSQL, see <a href="./c_redshift-and-postgres-sql.html">Amazon Redshift and PostgreSQL</a>.</p><p>
            <b>Clusters</b>
        </p><p>The core infrastructure component of an Amazon Redshift data warehouse is a
                <em>cluster</em>.</p><p>A cluster is composed of one or more <em>compute nodes</em>. If a cluster
            is provisioned with two or more compute nodes, an additional <em>leader
                node</em> coordinates the compute nodes and handles external communication.
            Your client application interacts directly only with the leader node. The compute nodes
            are transparent to external applications.</p><p>
            <b>Leader node</b>
        </p><p>The leader node manages communications with client programs and all communication with
            compute nodes. It parses and develops execution plans to carry out database operations,
            in particular, the series of steps necessary to obtain results for complex queries.
            Based on the execution plan, the leader node compiles code, distributes the compiled
            code to the compute nodes, and assigns a portion of the data to each compute
            node.</p><p>The leader node distributes SQL statements to the compute nodes only when a query
            references tables that are stored on the compute nodes. All other queries run
            exclusively on the leader node. Amazon Redshift is designed to implement certain SQL functions
            only on the leader node. A query that uses any of these functions will return an error
            if it references tables that reside on the compute nodes. For more information, see
                <a href="./c_sql-functions-leader-node.html">SQL functions supported on the leader
               node</a>.</p><p>
            <b>Compute nodes</b>
        </p><p>The leader node compiles code for individual elements of the execution plan and
            assigns the code to individual compute nodes. The compute nodes run the compiled code
            and send intermediate results back to the leader node for final aggregation. </p><p>Each compute node has its own dedicated CPU and memory, which are determined by the
            node type. As your workload grows, you can increase the compute capacity of a cluster by
            increasing the number of nodes, upgrading the node type, or both.</p><p>Amazon Redshift provides several node types for your compute needs. For details of each node
            type, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html">Amazon Redshift clusters</a> in
            the <em>Amazon Redshift Management Guide</em>. </p><p>
           <b>Redshift Managed Storage</b>
       </p><p>Data warehouse data is stored in a separate storage tier Redshift Managed Storage
            (RMS). RMS provides the ability to scale your storage to petabytes using Amazon S3 storage.
            RMS lets you scale and pay for computing and storage independently, so that you can
            size your cluster based only on your computing needs. It automatically uses
            high-performance SSD-based local storage as tier-1 cache. It also takes advantage of
            optimizations, such as data block temperature, data block age, and workload patterns to
            deliver high performance while scaling storage automatically to Amazon S3 when needed without
            requiring any action.</p><p>
            <b>Node slices</b>
        </p><p>A compute node is partitioned into slices. Each slice is allocated a portion of the
            node's memory and disk space, where it processes a portion of the workload assigned to
            the node. The leader node manages distributing data to the slices and apportions the
            workload for any queries or other database operations to the slices. The slices then
            work in parallel to complete the operation.</p><p>The number of slices per node is determined by the node size of the cluster. For more
            information about the number of slices for each node size, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html#rs-about-clusters-and-nodes">About
                clusters and nodes</a> in the <em>Amazon Redshift Management Guide</em>.</p><p>When you create a table, you can optionally specify one column as the distribution
            key. When the table is loaded with data, the rows are distributed to the node slices
            according to the distribution key that is defined for a table. Choosing a good
            distribution key enables Amazon Redshift to use parallel processing to load data and run
            queries efficiently. For information about choosing a distribution key, see <a href="./c_best-practices-best-dist-key.html">Choose the best distribution
               style</a>.</p><p>
            <b>Internal network</b>
        </p><p>Amazon Redshift takes advantage of high-bandwidth connections, close proximity, and custom
            communication protocols to provide private, very high-speed network communication
            between the leader node and compute nodes. The compute nodes run on a separate, isolated
            network that client applications never access directly.</p><p>
            <b>Databases</b>
        </p><p>A cluster contains one or more databases. User data is stored on the compute nodes.
            Your SQL client communicates with the leader node, which in turn coordinates query
            run with the compute nodes.</p><p>Amazon Redshift is a relational database management system (RDBMS), so it is compatible with
            other RDBMS applications. Although it provides the same functionality as a typical
            RDBMS, including online transaction processing (OLTP) functions such as inserting and
            deleting data, Amazon Redshift is optimized for high-performance analysis and reporting of very
            large datasets.</p><p>Amazon Redshift is based on PostgreSQL. Amazon Redshift and PostgreSQL have a number of very
            important differences that you need to take into account as you design and develop your
            data warehouse applications. For information about how Amazon Redshift SQL differs from
            PostgreSQL, see <a href="./c_redshift-and-postgres-sql.html">Amazon Redshift and PostgreSQL</a>.</p><awsdocs-copyright class="copyright-print"></awsdocs-copyright><awsdocs-thumb-feedback right-edge="{{$ctrl.thumbFeedbackRightEdge}}"></awsdocs-thumb-feedback></div><noscript><div><div><div><div id="js_error_message"><p><img src="https://d1ge0kk1l5kms0.cloudfront.net/images/G/01/webservices/console/warning.png" alt="Warning" /> <strong>Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.</strong></p><p>To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
