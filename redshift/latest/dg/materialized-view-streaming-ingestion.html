            Streaming ingestion provides 
            low-latency, high-speed ingestion of stream data from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com//kinesis/data-streams/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> 
            and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com//msk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> into an Amazon Redshift provisioned or Amazon Redshift Serverless materialized view. It 
            lowers the time it takes to access data and it reduces storage cost. You can configure 
            streaming ingestion for your Amazon Redshift cluster or for Amazon Redshift Serverless and create a materialized view,  
            using SQL statements, as described in <a href="./materialized-view-overview.html">Creating materialized views in Amazon Redshift</a>. After that, using materialized-view 
            refresh, you can ingest hundreds of megabytes of data per second. 
            This results in fast access to external data that is quickly refreshed.
        </p>
            <h2 id="materialized-view-streaming-ingestion-data-flow">Data flow</h2>
            <p>
                An Amazon Redshift provisioned cluster or an Amazon Redshift Serverless workgroup is the stream consumer. A materialized view is the landing 
                area for data read from the stream, which is processed as it arrives. For instance, JSON values can 
                be consumed and mapped to the materialized view's data columns, using familiar SQL. When the materialized view is 
                refreshed,  Redshift consumes data from allocated Kinesis data shards or Kafka partitions until the view reaches parity with 
                the <code class="code">SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> for the Kinesis stream or last <code class="code">Offset</code> for the Kafka topic. Subsequent materialized 
                view refreshes read data from the last <code class="code">SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> of the 
                previous refresh until it reaches parity with the stream or topic data.
            </p>
      
     
         
            <h2 id="materialized-view-streaming-ingestion-use-cases">Streaming ingestion use cases</h2>
            <p> Use cases for Amazon Redshift streaming ingestion involve working with data that's
                generated continually (streamed) and
                must
                be processed within a short period (latency) of its generation. This is called near
                real-time
                analytics. Sources of data can vary, and include
                IoT
                devices, system telemetry data, or clickstream data from a busy website or application. </p>
         
                <h2 id="materialized-view-streaming-ingestion-considerations">Streaming ingestion considerations</h2>
                <p>The following are important considerations and best practices for performance and 
                    billing as you set up your streaming ingestion environment.</p>

                   <p>Auto refresh can be turned on explicitly for a materialized view created for streaming 
                       ingestion. To do this, specify <code class="code">AUTO REFRESH</code> in the materialized view definition. Manual refresh is the default. To specify auto refresh for an 
                       existing materialized view for streaming ingestion, you can run <code class="code">ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW</code> to turn it on. For more information,

                        There are several options for streaming data to Amazon Redshift or to Amazon Redshift Serverless. Two well-known options are streaming ingestion, as described in 
                        this topic, or setting up a delivery stream to Amazon S3 with Firehose. The following list describes each method:

                            into Amazon Redshift using Kinesis Data Streams and streaming through Firehose involves connecting the source stream to Amazon Data Firehose and waiting for Firehose to 
                            stage the data in Amazon S3. This process makes use of various-sized batches at varying-length buffer intervals. After streaming to Amazon S3, Firehose initiates a COPY 
                            command to load the data. </p></li></ol></div>
