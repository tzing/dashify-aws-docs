         modifying the WLM configuration to create separate queues for the long-running queries
         and short-running queries.</p><p>When users run queries in Amazon Redshift, the queries are routed to query queues. Each query
         queue contains a number of query slots. Each queue is allocated a portion of the cluster's
         available memory. A queue's memory is divided among the queue's query slots. You can 
         enable Amazon Redshift to manage query concurrency with automatic WLM. 
         For more information, see <a href="./automatic-wlm.html">Implementing automatic WLM</a>.</p><p>Or you can configure WLM properties for each query queue. You do so to specify the way
         that memory is allocated among slots and how queries can be routed to specific queues at
         runtime. You can also configure WLM properties to cancel long-running queries.</p><p>By default, Amazon Redshift configures the following query queues:</p><div class="itemizedlist">

            <p>
               <b>One superuser queue</b>
            </p>
            <p>The superuser queue is reserved for superusers only and it can't be configured.
               Use this queue only when you need to run queries that affect the system or for
               troubleshooting purposes. For example, use this queue when you need to cancel a
               user's long-running query or to add users to the database. Don't use it to
               perform routine queries. The queue doesn't appear in the console, but it does appear
               in the system tables in the database as the fifth queue. To run a query in the
               superuser queue, a user must be logged in as a superuser, and must run the query
               using the predefined <code class="code">superuser</code> query group.</p>
         </li><li class="listitem">

            </p>
            <p>The default queue is initially configured to run five queries concurrently. When you use manual WLM, you
               can change the concurrency, timeout, and memory allocation properties for the default
               queue, but you cannot specify user groups or query groups. The default queue must be
               the last queue in the WLM configuration. Any queries that are not routed to other

         <h2 id="concurrency-scaling-mode">Concurrency scaling mode</h2>
         <p>When concurrency scaling is enabled, Amazon Redshift automatically adds additional cluster
            capacity when you need it to process an increase in concurrent read and write queries. Users see the most current data,
            whether the queries run on the main cluster or on a concurrency scaling cluster. </p>
         <p>You manage which queries are sent to the concurrency scaling cluster by configuring
            WLM queues. When you enable concurrency scaling for a queue, eligible queries are sent
            to the concurrency scaling cluster instead of waiting in a queue. For more information, see
               <a href="./concurrency-scaling.html">Working with concurrency scaling</a>.</p>
       
         <h2 id="cm-c-defining-query-queues-concurrency-level">Concurrency level</h2>
         <p>Queries in a queue run concurrently until they reach the WLM query slot count, or
            <em>concurrency</em> level, defined for that queue. Subsequent queries
            then wait in the queue.</p>
         <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>WLM concurrency level is different from the number of concurrent user connections
               that can be made to a cluster. 
               
               For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-to-cluster.html">Connecting to a Cluster</a> in the
               <em>Amazon Redshift Management Guide</em>.</p></div></div>
         <p>In an automatic WLM configuration, which is recommended, the concurrency level is set to
            <b>Auto</b>. Amazon Redshift dynamically allocates memory to queries, which subsequently determines how many to 
            run concurrently. This is based on the resources required for both running and queued queries. Auto WLM isn't 
            configurable. For more information, see <a href="./automatic-wlm.html">Implementing automatic WLM</a>. </p>
        
         <p>In a manual WLM configuration, Amazon Redshift statically allocates a fixed amount of memory to each 
            queue. The queue's memory is split evenly among the query slots. To illustrate, if a queue is 
            allocated 20% of a cluster's memory and has 10 slots, each query is allocated 2% of the cluster's 
            memory. The memory allocation remains fixed regardless of the number 
            of queries running concurrently. Because of this fixed memory allocation, queries that run 
            entirely in memory when the slot count is 5 might write intermediate results to disk if the slot count is increased 
            to 20. In this instance each query's share of the queue's memory is reduced from 1/5th 
            to 1/20th. The additional disk I/O could degrade performance. 
         </p>
         <p>The maximum slot count across all user-defined queues is 50. This limits the total slots for all 
            queues, including the default queue. The only queue that 
            isn't subject to the limit is the reserved superuser queue.</p>
      
  
         
   
         <p>By default, manual WLM queues have a concurrency level of 5. Your workload might benefit
            from a higher concurrency level in certain cases, such as the following:</p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
             
             
         <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
               <p>If many small queries are forced to wait for long-running queries, create a
                  separate queue with a higher slot count and assign the smaller queries to that
                  queue. A queue with a higher concurrency level has less memory allocated to each
                  query slot, but the smaller queries require less memory.</p>
               <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>If you enable short-query acceleration (SQA), WLM automatically prioritizes
                     short queries over longer-running queries, so you don't need a separate queue
                     for short queries for most workflows. For more information, see <a href="./wlm-short-query-acceleration.html">Working with short query
            acceleration</a>. </p></div></div>
            </li><li class="listitem">
               <p>If you have multiple queries that each access data on a single slice, set up a
                  separate WLM queue to run those queries concurrently. Amazon Redshift assigns
                  concurrent queries to separate slices, which allows multiple queries to run in
                  parallel on multiple slices. For example, if a query is a simple aggregate with a
                  predicate on the distribution key, the data for the query is located on a single
                  slice. </p>
            </li></ul></div>

            <p>
               This example is a simple, manual WLM scenario to show how slots and memory can be allocated. You implement manual WLM with three queues, which are the following:
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
                
                
                
            <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><em>data-ingestion queue</em> – This is set up for ingesting data. It's allocated 20% of the 
                  cluster's memory and it has 5 slots. Subsequently, 5 queries can run concurrently in the queue and each is allocated 
                  4% of the memory.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><em>data-scientist queue</em> – This is designed for memory-intensive queries. It's 
                  allocated 40% of the cluster's memory and it has 5 slots. Subsequently, 5 queries can run concurrently and each is

                  40 slots. 40 queries can run concurrently in this queue, with each query allocated 1% of the memory. This is the 
                  maximum number of slots that can be allocated for this queue because between all queues the limit is 50.</p></li></ul></div>
  
          
         
         <p>If you're running automatic WLM and your workload requires more than 15 queries to run in parallel, we recommend 
            turning on concurrency scaling. This is because increasing the query slot count above 15 might create contention for 
            system resources and limit the overall throughput of a single cluster. With concurrency scaling, you can run hundreds 
            of queries in parallel, up to a configured number of concurrency scaling clusters. 
            The number of concurrency scaling clusters is controlled by

         <p>You can assign a set of user groups to a queue by specifying each user group name or
            by using wildcards. When a member of a listed user group runs a query, that query runs
            in the corresponding queue. There is no set limit on the number of user groups that can
            be assigned to a queue.  For more information, see

            query group label to a series of queries. Any queries that are assigned to a listed
            query group run in the corresponding queue. There is no set limit to the number of query
            groups that can be assigned to a queue. For more
            information, see <a href="./cm-c-executing-queries.html#cm-c-executing-queries-assigning-a-query-to-a-query-group">Assigning a
               query to a query group</a>. </p>
       
         <h2 id="wlm-wildcards">Wildcards</h2>
         
         <p>If wildcards are enabled in the WLM queue configuration, you can assign user groups
            and query groups to a queue either individually or by using Unix shell-style wildcards.
            The pattern matching is case-insensitive. </p>
         <p>For example, the '*' wildcard character matches any number of characters. Thus, if
            you add <code class="code">dba_*</code> to the list of user groups for a queue, any user-run query
            that belongs to a group with a name that begins with <code class="code">dba_</code> is assigned to
            that queue. Examples are <code class="code">dba_admin</code> or <code class="code">DBA_primary</code>, . The '?'
            wildcard character matches any single character. Thus, if the queue includes user-group
            <code class="code">dba?1</code>, then user groups named <code class="code">dba11</code> and <code class="code">dba21</code>
            match, but <code class="code">dba12</code> doesn't match. </p>
         <p>Wildcards are turned off by default.</p>
       
         <h2 id="wlm-memory-percent">WLM memory percent to use</h2>
         <p>In an automatic WLM configuration, memory percent is set to <code class="userinput">auto</code>. For more information, see
            <a href="./automatic-wlm.html">Implementing automatic WLM</a>. </p>
         
         <p>In a manual WLM configuration, to specify the amount of available memory that is allocated to a query, you can set
            the <code class="code">WLM Memory Percent to Use</code> parameter. By default, each user-defined
            queue is allocated an equal portion of the memory that is available for user-defined
            queries. For example, if you have four user-defined queues, each queue is allocated 25
            percent of the available memory. The superuser queue has its own allocated memory and
            cannot be modified. To change the allocation, you assign an integer percentage of memory
            to each queue, up to a total of 100 percent. Any unallocated memory is managed by
            Amazon Redshift and can be temporarily given to a queue if the queue requests additional memory
            for processing. </p>
         <p>For example, if you configure four queues, you can allocate memory as follows: 20
            percent, 30 percent, 15 percent, 15 percent. The remaining 20 percent is unallocated and
            managed by the service.</p>
       
         <h2 id="wlm-timeout">WLM timeout</h2>
         <p>WLM timeout (<code class="code">max_execution_time</code>) is deprecated. 
            Instead, create a query monitoring rule (QMR) using <code class="code">query_execution_time</code> to limit the elapsed execution time for a query.
            For more information, see <a href="./cm-c-wlm-query-monitoring-rules.html">WLM query monitoring rules</a>. </p>
         
         <p>To limit the amount of time that queries in a given WLM queue are permitted to use,
            you can set the WLM timeout value for each queue. The timeout parameter specifies the
            amount of time, in milliseconds, that Amazon Redshift waits for a query to run before
            either canceling or hopping the query. The timeout is based on query execution time and
            doesn't include time spent waiting in a queue. </p>
         <p>WLM attempts to hop <a href="./r_CREATE_TABLE_AS.html">CREATE TABLE AS</a> (CTAS) statements and read-only queries, such as
            SELECT statements. Queries that can't be hopped are canceled. For more information, see
            <a href="./wlm-queue-hopping.html">WLM query queue hopping</a>.</p>
         <p>WLM timeout doesn't apply to a query that has reached the returning state. To view
            the state of a query, see the <a href="./r_STV_WLM_QUERY_STATE.html">STV_WLM_QUERY_STATE</a> system table. COPY statements and maintenance
            operations, such as ANALYZE and VACUUM, are not subject to WLM timeout.</p>
         <p>The function of WLM timeout is similar to the <a href="./r_statement_timeout.html">statement_timeout</a> configuration parameter. The difference is
            that, where the <code class="code">statement_timeout</code> configuration parameter applies to the
            entire cluster, WLM timeout is specific to a single queue in the WLM configuration. </p>
         <p>If <a href="./r_statement_timeout.html">statement_timeout</a> is also
            specified, the lower of statement_timeout and WLM timeout (max_execution_time) is used.
         </p>
       
         <h2 id="wlm-query-monitoring-rules">Query monitoring rules</h2>
         

         <p>Query monitoring rules define metrics-based performance boundaries for WLM queues and
            specify what action to take when a query goes beyond those boundaries. For example, for
            a queue dedicated to short running queries, you might create a rule that cancels queries
            that run for more than 60 seconds. To track poorly designed queries, you might have
            another rule that logs queries that contain nested loops. For more information, see
            <a href="./cm-c-wlm-query-monitoring-rules.html">WLM query monitoring rules</a>.</p>
