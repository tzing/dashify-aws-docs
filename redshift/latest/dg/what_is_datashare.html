            <h2 id="adx_datashare_overview">AWS Data Exchange datashares</h2>
            <p>An AWS Data Exchange datashare is a unit of licensing for sharing your data through AWS Data Exchange. AWS manages all billing and payments associated with subscriptions to AWS Data Exchange and use of Amazon Redshift data sharing. Approved data providers can add AWS Data Exchange datashares to AWS Data Exchange products. When customers subscribe to a product with AWS Data Exchange datashares, they get access to the datashares in the product.</p>
            
            <p><em>AWS Data Exchange for Amazon Redshift</em> makes it convenient to license
               access to your Amazon Redshift data through AWS Data Exchange. When a customer subscribes to a product with
               AWS Data Exchange datashares, AWS Data Exchange automatically adds the customer as a data consumer on all AWS Data Exchange
               datashares included with the product. Invoices are automatically generated, and payments
               are centrally collected and automatically disbursed through AWS Marketplace Entitlement Service.</p>
            <p>Providers can license data in Amazon Redshift at a granular level, such as schemas, tables,
               views, and user-defined functions. You can use the same AWS Data Exchange datashare across multiple
               AWS Data Exchange products. Any objects added to the AWS Data Exchange datashare is available to consumers.
               Producers can view all AWS Data Exchange datashares managed by AWS Data Exchange on their behalf using Amazon Redshift
               API operations, SQL commands, and the Amazon Redshift console. Customers who subscribe to a
               product AWS Data Exchange datashares have read-only access to the objects in the datashares. </p>
            <p>Customers who want to consume third-party producer data can browse the AWS Data Exchange catalog
               to discover and subscribe to datasets in Amazon Redshift. After their AWS Data Exchange subscription is
               active, they can create a database from the datashare in their cluster and query the data
               in Amazon Redshift.</p>

                     If
                     you are a data producer (also known as a provider on AWS Data Exchange), you can create
                     AWS Data Exchange datashares that connect to your Amazon Redshift databases. To add AWS Data Exchange datashares to
                     products on AWS Data Exchange, you must be a registered AWS Data Exchange provider.</p>
                  <p>For more information on how to get started with AWS Data Exchange datashares, see <a href="./adx-getting-started.html">Sharing licensed Amazon Redshift data on AWS Data Exchange</a>.</p>

                  <p>After you subscribe to a product that contains AWS Data Exchange datashares, create a database
                     from the datashare within your cluster. You can then query the data in Amazon Redshift

            <p> Using AWS Lake Formation, you can centrally define and enforce database, table, column, and row-level
               access permissions of Amazon Redshift datashares and restrict user access to objects within a
               datashare. By sharing data through Lake Formation, you can define permissions in Lake Formation and apply those permissions to any datashare and
               its objects. For example, if you have a table containing employee information, you can use
               Lake Formation's column-level filters to prevent employees who don't work in the HR department
               from seeing personally identifiable information (PII), such as a social security number. For more information about
               data filters, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/data-filtering.html">Data filtering and cell-level security in Lake Formation</a> in the
               <em>AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide</em>. </p>
            <p>You can also use tags in Lake Formation to configure permissions on Lake Formation resources. For more information, see
               <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/tag-based-access-control.html">Lake Formation Tag-based access control</a>.</p>
            <p>
               Amazon Redshift currently supports data sharing via Lake Formation when sharing within the same account or across accounts. 
               Cross-Region sharing is currently not supported.
            </p>
            <p>The following is a high-level overview of how to use Lake Formation to control datashare
               permissions:</p>
            <div class="procedure"><ol><li><p>In Amazon Redshift, the producer cluster or workgroup administrator creates a datashare on the producer cluster or workgroup and grants usage to
                  a Lake Formation account.</p></li><li><p>The producer cluster or workgroup administrator authorizes the Lake Formation account to access the datashare.</p></li><li><p>The Lake Formation administrator discovers and registers the datashares. They must also discover the AWS Glue ARNs they have access to and associate the datashares with an
                  AWS Glue Data Catalog ARN. If you're using the AWS CLI you can discover and accept datashares with the 
                  Redshift CLI operations <code class="code">describe-data-shares</code> and <code class="code">associate-data-share-consumer</code>. To register a datashare,
                  use the Lake Formation CLI operation <code class="code">register-resource</code>.</p></li><li><p>The Lake Formation administrator creates a federated database in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, and configures Lake Formation
                  permissions to control user access to objects within the datashare.  For more information about
                  federated databases in AWS Glue, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/data-sharing-redshift.html">Managing 
                     permissions for data in an Amazon Redshift datashare</a>.</p></li><li><p>The Lake Formation administrator discovers the AWS Glue databases they have access to and associates the
                  datashare with an AWS Glue Data Catalog ARN.</p></li><li><p>The Redshift administrator discovers the AWS Glue database ARNs they have access to, 
                  creates an external database in the Amazon Redshift consumer cluster using a AWS Glue database ARN, and 
                  grants usage to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/options-for-providing-iam-credentials.html">database users authenticated with IAM credentials</a> to start querying the Amazon Redshift database.</p></li><li><p>Database users can use the views SVV_EXTERNAL_TABLES and SVV_EXTERNAL_COLUMNS to find all of the tables or columns within
                  the AWS Glue database that they have access to, and then they can query the AWS Glue database’s tables.</p></li><li><p>When the producer cluster or workgroup administrator decides to no longer share the data with the consumer cluster, the producer 
                  cluster administrator can revoke usage, deauthorize, or delete the datashare from Redshift. The associated permissions and objects in 
                  Lake Formation are not automatically deleted.</p></li></ol></div>

         <h2 id="datashare_producer_consumer">Datashare producers and consumers</h2>
         <p><em>Data producers</em> (also known as data sharing
            producers or datashare producers) are clusters that you want to share data from.
            Producer cluster administrators and database owners can create datashares using the CREATE DATASHARE command. You can add objects such as schemas, tables, views,
            and SQL user-defined functions (UDFs) from a database that you want the producer
            cluster to share with consumer clusters for read purposes.</p>
         <p>Data producers (also known as providers on AWS Data Exchange) for AWS Data Exchange datashares can license data
            through AWS Data Exchange. Approved providers can add AWS Data Exchange datashares to AWS Data Exchange
            products. </p>
         <p>When a customer subscribes to a product with AWS Data Exchange datashares,
            AWS Data Exchange automatically adds the customer as a data consumer on all AWS Data Exchange
            datashares included with the product. AWS Data Exchange also removes all customers from
            AWS Data Exchange datashares when their subscription ends. AWS Data Exchange also automatically
            manages billing, invoicing, payment collection, and payment distribution for paid
            products with AWS Data Exchange datashares. For more information, see <a href="#adx_datashare_overview">AWS Data Exchange datashares</a>. To register as an
            AWS Data Exchange data provider, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/provider-getting-started.html">Getting started as a provider</a>.</p>
         
         <p><em>Data consumers</em> (also known as data sharing
            consumers or datashare consumers) are clusters that receive datashares from
            producer clusters. </p>
         <p>Amazon Redshift clusters that share data can be in the same or different AWS accounts or
            different AWS Regions, so you can share data across organizations and
            collaborate with other parties. Consumer cluster administrators receive the
            datashares that they are granted usage for and review the contents of each
            datashare. To consume shared data, the consumer cluster administrator creates an
            Amazon Redshift database from the datashare. The administrator then assigns permissions for
            the database to users and roles in the consumer cluster. After permissions are
            granted, users and roles can list the shared objects as part of the standard
            metadata queries, along with the local data on the consumer cluster. They can
            start querying immediately.</p>
         <p>If you are a <em>consumer with an active AWS Data Exchange subscription</em> (also known
            as subscribers on AWS Data Exchange), you can find, subscribe to, and query
            granular, up-to-date data in Amazon Redshift without the need to extract, transform, and
            load the data. For more information, see <a href="#adx_datashare_overview">AWS Data Exchange datashares</a>.</p>
