      </div><p>For information about the prerequisites for setting up your Redshift cluster,
         permissions, and ownership for using Amazon Redshift ML, read the following sections. These
         sections also describe how simple training and predictions work in Amazon Redshift ML.</p>
         <h2 id="solve_problem">How machine learning can solve a problem</h2>
         <p>A machine learning model generates predictions by finding patterns in your training
            data and then applying these patterns to new data. In machine learning, you train these
            models by learning the patterns that best explain your data. Then you use the models to
            make predictions (also called inferences) on new data. Machine learning is typically an
            iterative process where you can continue to improve the accuracy of the predictions by
            changing parameters and improving your training data. If data changes, retraining new
            models with the new dataset happens. </p>
         <p>To address various business goals, there are different fundamental machine learning
            approaches.</p>
          
            <h3 id="supervised_learning">Supervised learning in Amazon Redshift ML</h3>
            <p>Amazon Redshift supports supervised learning, which is the most common approach to
               advanced enterprise analytics. Supervised learning is the preferred machine learning
               approach when you have an established set of data and an understanding of how
               specific input data predicts various business outcomes. These outcomes are sometimes
               called labels. In particular, your dataset is a table with attributes that comprise
               features (inputs) and targets (outputs). For example, suppose that you have a table
               that provides the age and postal code for past and present customers. Suppose that
               you also have a field “active” that is true for present customers and false for
               customers who have suspended their membership. The goal of supervised machine
               learning is to spot the patterns of age and postal code leading to customer churn, as
               represented by customers whose targets are “False.” You can use this model to predict
               customers who are likely to churn, such as suspending their membership, and
               potentially offer retention incentives.</p>
            <p>Amazon Redshift supports supervised learning that includes regression, binary
               classification, and multiclass classification. Regression refers to the problem of
               predicting continuous values, such as the total spending of customers. Binary
               classification refers to the problem of predicting one of two outcomes, such as
               predicting whether a customer churns or not. Multiclass classification refers to the
               problem of predicting one of many outcomes, such as predicting the item a customer
               might be interested. Data analysts and data scientists can use it to perform
               supervised learning to tackle problems ranging from forecasting, personalization, or
               customer churn prediction. You can also use supervised learning in problems such as
               prediction of which sales will close, revenue prediction, fraud detection, and
               customer life-time value prediction. </p>
          
          
            <h3 id="unsupervised_learning">Unsupervised learning in Amazon Redshift ML</h3>
            <p>Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and group
               unlabeled training data. The algorithms discover hidden patterns or groupings. The
               goal is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data to learn more
               about the data.</p>
            <p>Amazon Redshift supports the K-Means clustering algorithm to solve an unsupervised
               learning problem. This algorithm solves clustering problems where you want to
               discover groupings in the data. The K-Means algorithm attempts to find discrete
               groupings within the data. Unclassified data is grouped and partitioned based on its
               similarities and differences. By grouping, the K-Means algorithm iteratively
               determines the best centroids and assigns each member to the closest centroid.
               Members nearest the same centroid belong to the same group. Members of a group are as
               similar as possible to other members in the same group, and as different as possible
               from members of other groups. For example, the K-Means clustering algorithm can be
               used to classify cities impacted by a pandemic or classify cities based on the
               popularity of consumer products.</p>
            <p>When using the K-Means algorithm, you specify an input <code class="code">k</code> that
               specifies the number of clusters to find in the data. The output of this algorithm is
               a set of k centroids. Each data point belongs to one of the k clusters that is
               closest to it. Each cluster is described by its centroid. The centroid can be thought
               of as the multi-dimensional average of the cluster. The K-Means algorithm compares
               the distances to see how different the clusters are from each other. A larger
               distance generally indicates a greater difference between the clusters.</p>
            <p>Preprocessing the data is important for K-Means, as it ensures that the features
               of the model stay on the same scale and produce reliable results. Amazon Redshift supports
               some K-Means preprocessors for the CREATE MODEL statement, such as StandardScaler,
               MinMax, and NumericPassthrough. If you don't want to apply any preprocessing for
               K-means, choose NumericPassthrough explicitly as a transformer. For more information
               about K-Means parameters, see <a href="./r_create_model_use_cases.html#r_k-means-create-model-parameters">CREATE MODEL with K-MEANS
                    parameters</a>.</p>

               K-Means clustering, you can watch the following video. </p>

         <h2 id="terminology">Terms and concepts for Amazon Redshift ML</h2>
         <p>The following terms are used to describe some Amazon Redshift ML concepts:</p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
             
             
             
            
             
             
             
         <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
               <p><em>Machine learning</em> in Amazon Redshift trains a model
                  with one SQL command. Amazon Redshift ML and Amazon SageMaker manage all the data conversions,
                  permissions, resource usage, and discovery of the proper model. </p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
               <p><em>Training</em> is the phase when Amazon Redshift creates
                  a machine learning model by running a specified subset of data into the model.
                  Amazon Redshift automatically launches a training job in Amazon SageMaker and generates a model.
               </p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
               <p><em>Prediction</em> (also called <em>inference</em>) is the use of the model in Amazon Redshift SQL
                  queries to predict outcomes. At inference time, Amazon Redshift uses a model-based
                  prediction function as part of a larger query to produce predictions. The
                  predictions are computed locally, at the Redshift cluster, thus providing high
                  throughput, low latency, and zero additional cost.</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
               <p>With <em>bring your own model (BYOM)</em>, you can
                  use a model trained outside of Amazon Redshift with Amazon SageMaker for in-database inference
                  locally in Amazon Redshift. Amazon Redshift ML supports using BYOM in
                  local inference.</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
               <p><em>Local inference</em> is used when models are
                  pretrained in Amazon SageMaker, compiled by Amazon SageMaker Neo, and localized in Amazon Redshift ML. To
                  import models that are supported for local inference to Amazon Redshift, use the CREATE
                  MODEL command. Amazon Redshift imports the pretrained SageMaker models by calling Amazon SageMaker
                  Neo. You compile the model there and import the compiled model into Amazon Redshift. Use
                  local inference for faster speed and lower costs.</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
               <p><em>Remote inference</em> is used when Amazon Redshift
                  invokes a model endpoint deployed in SageMaker. Remote inference provides the
                  flexibility to invoke all types of custom models and deep learning models, such as
                  TensorFlow models that you built and deployed in Amazon SageMaker.</p>
