      all your data using standard SQL with your existing business intelligence (BI) tools. Amazon Redshift
      offers fast performance in a low-cost cloud data warehouse. It uses sophisticated query
      optimization, accelerated cache, columnar storage on high-performance local disks, and
      massively parallel query execution. </p><p>In the following sections, you can find a framework for building a proof of concept with
      Amazon Redshift. The framework helps you to use architectural best practices for designing and operating
      a secure, high-performing, and cost-effective data warehouse. This guidance is based on
      reviewing designs of thousands of customer architectures across a wide variety of business
      types and use cases. We have compiled customer experiences to develop this set of best
      practices to help you develop criteria for evaluating your data warehouse workload. </p>
      <h2 id="proof-of-concept-overview">Overview of the process</h2>
	  <p>Conducting a proof of concept is a three-step process:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
          
          
          
      <ol><li><p>Identify the goals of the proof of concept – you can work backward from your business
               requirements and success criteria, and translate them into a technical proof of
               concept project plan. </p></li><li><p>Set up the proof of concept environment – most of the setup process is a click of few
               buttons to create your resources. Within minutes, you can have a data warehouse
               environment ready with data loaded. </p></li><li><p>Complete the proof of concept project plan to ensure that the goals are met. </p></li></ol></div>
         
	  <p>In the following sections, we go into the details of each step.</p>
	   
      <h2 id="proof-of-concept-goals">Identify the business goals and success criteria</h2>

      <p>Identifying the goals of the proof of concept plays a critical role in determining what
         you want to measure as part of the evaluation process. The evaluation criteria should
         include the current scaling challenges, enhancements to improve your customer's experience
         of the data warehouse, and methods of addressing your current operational pain points. You
         can use the following questions to identify the goals of the proof of concept: </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
          
          
          
          
          
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>What are your goals for scaling your data warehouse? </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What are the specific service-level agreements whose terms you want to improve? </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What new datasets do you need to include in your data warehouse? </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What are the business-critical SQL queries that you need to test and measure? Make sure to
               include the full range of SQL complexities, such as the different types of queries
               (for example, select, insert, update, and delete). </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What are the general types of workloads you plan to test? 
            Examples might include extract-transform-load (ETL) workloads, reporting queries, and batch extracts. </p></li></ul></div>
      <p>After you have answered these questions, you should be able to establish SMART goals and success criteria for building your proof of concept. 
            For information about setting goals, see 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>SMART criteria</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> in <em>Wikipedia</em>. </p>

    
      <h2 id="proof-of-concept-set-up">Set up your proof of concept</h2>
      
      <p>Because we eliminated hardware provisioning, networking, and software installation from
         an on-premises data warehouse, trying Amazon Redshift with your own dataset has never been easier.
         Many of the sizing decisions and estimations that used to be required are now simply a
         click away. You can flexibly resize your cluster or adjust the ratio of storage versus
         compute.
         </p>
      <p>Broadly, setting up the Amazon Redshift proof of concept environment is a two-step process. It
         involves the launching of a data warehouse and then the conversion of the schema and
         datasets for evaluation.</p>
      

       
         <h3 id="proof-of-concept-choose-node-type">Choose a starting cluster size</h3>
         
         <p>You can choose the node type and number of nodes using the Amazon Redshift console. We recommend
            that you also test resizing the cluster as part of your proof of concept plan. To get
            the initial sizing for your cluster, take the following steps:</p>
         <div class="orderedlist">
             
             
             
            
             


             
         <ol><li><p>Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at
         <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p></li><li><p>On the navigation menu, choose <b>Create cluster</b> to open the configuration
                  page. </p></li><li><p>For <b>Cluster identifier</b>, enter a name for your cluster.  </p></li><li>                  
               <p>The following step describes an Amazon Redshift console that is running in an AWS Region that supports RA3 node types. 
                    For a list of AWS Regions that support RA3 node types, see 
                     <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html#rs-ra3-node-types">Overview of RA3 node types</a> in the <em>Amazon Redshift Management Guide</em>. </p>
               

                     
                     <p>If you don't know how large to size your cluster, choose <b>Help me
                        choose</b>. Doing this starts a sizing calculator that asks you
                        questions about the size and query characteristics of the data that you plan
                        to store in your data warehouse.
                        If you know the required size of your cluster (that is, the node type and
                        number of nodes), choose <b>I'll choose</b>. Then choose the
                        <b>Node type</b> and number of <b>Nodes</b>
                        to size your cluster for the proof of concept.</p>

            <p>Amazon Redshift is a relational database management system (RDBMS). As such, it can run many
            types of data models including star schemas, snowflake schemas, data vault models, and
            simple, flat, or normalized tables. After setting up your schemas in Amazon Redshift, you can take
            advantage of massively parallel processing and columnar data storage for fast analytical
            queries out of the box.

         including the following items in your success criteria: </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
         
         
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Data load time</b> – using the
                  <code class="code">COPY</code> command is a common way to test how long it takes to load data.
               For more information, see 
               <a href="./c_loading-data-best-practices.html">Amazon Redshift best practices for loading
            data</a>. </p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Throughput of the cluster</b> – measuring
               queries per hour is a common way to determine throughput. To do so, set up a test to
               run typical queries for your workload. </p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Data security</b> – you can easily encrypt
               data at rest and in transit with Amazon Redshift. You also have a number of options for managing
               keys. Amazon Redshift also supports single sign-on integration. Amazon Redshift pricing includes
               built-in security, data compression, backup storage, and data transfer.</p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Third-party tools integration</b> – you can
               use either a JDBC or ODBC connection to integrate with business intelligence and
               other external tools. </p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Interoperability with other AWS services</b> –
               Amazon Redshift integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon EMR, Amazon QuickSight, AWS Glue, Amazon S3, and Amazon Kinesis.
               You can use this integration when setting up and managing your data warehouse.</p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Backups and snapshots</b> – backups and
               snapshots are created automatically. You can also create a point-in-time snapshot at
               any time or on a schedule. Try using a snapshot and creating a second cluster as part
               of your evaluation. Evaluate if your development and testing organizations can use
               the cluster. </p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Resizing</b> – your evaluation should include
               increasing the number or types of Amazon Redshift nodes. Evaluate that the workload throughput
               before and after a resize meets any variability of the volume of your workload.
               For more information, see 
               <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-cluster-operations.html#rs-resize-tutorial">Resizing clusters in Amazon Redshift</a> in the <em>Amazon Redshift Management Guide</em>. </p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Concurrency scaling</b> – this feature helps
               you handle variability of traffic volume in your data warehouse. With concurrency
               scaling, you can support virtually unlimited concurrent users and concurrent queries,
               with consistently fast query performance. For more information, see <a href="./concurrency-scaling.html">Working with concurrency scaling</a>. </p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Automatic workload management (WLM)</b> –
               prioritize your business critical queries over other queries by using automatic WLM.
               Try setting up queues based on your workloads (for example, a queue for ETL and a
               queue for reporting). Then enable automatic WLM to allocate the concurrency and
               memory resources dynamically. For more information, see <a href="./automatic-wlm.html">Implementing automatic WLM</a>. </p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Amazon Redshift Advisor</b> – the Advisor develops
               customized recommendations to increase performance and optimize costs by analyzing
               your workload and usage metrics for your cluster. Sign in to the Amazon Redshift console to view
               Advisor recommendations. For more information, see <a href="./advisor.html">Working with recommendations from Amazon Redshift Advisor</a>.</p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Table design</b> – Amazon Redshift provides great
               performance out of the box for most workloads. 
               
               When you create a table, the default sort key and distribution key is <code class="code">AUTO</code>.
               For more information, see <a href="./t_Creating_tables.html">Working with automatic table optimization</a>.
               </p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Support</b> – we strongly recommend that you
               evaluate AWS Support as part of your evaluation. Also, make sure to talk to your
               account manager about your proof of concept. AWS can help with technical guidance and
               credits for the proof of concept if you qualify. If you don't find the help
               you're looking for, you can talk directly to the Amazon Redshift team. For help, submit the

         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Lake house integration</b> – with built-in
               integration, try using the out-of-box Amazon Redshift Spectrum feature. With Redshift Spectrum, you can extend the
               data warehouse into your data lake and run queries against petabytes of data in Amazon S3
               using your existing cluster. For more information, see <a href="./c-using-spectrum.html">Querying external data using Amazon Redshift Spectrum</a>. </p>

      <h2 id="proof-of-concept-evaluation-plan">Develop a project plan for your
            evaluation</h2>
      <p>Some of the following techniques for creating query benchmarks might help support your
         Amazon Redshift evaluation:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
          
          

          
          
         


      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
            <p>Assemble a list of queries for each runtime category. Having a sufficient number
               (for example, 30 per category) helps ensure that your evaluation reflects a
               real-world data warehouse implementation. Add a unique identifier to associate each
               query that you include in your evaluation with one of the categories you establish
               for your evaluation. You can then use these unique identifiers to determine
               throughput from the system tables. </p>
            <p>You can also create a query group to organize your evaluation queries. For
               example, if you have established a "Reporting" category for your evaluation, you
               might create a coding system to tag your evaluation queries with the word "Report."
               You can then identify individual queries within reporting as R1, R2, and so on. The
               following example demonstrates this approach.</p>
            <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="">
SELECT 'Reporting' AS query_category, 'R1' as query_id, * FROM customers;              
</code></pre>


            <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="sql ">
SELECT query, datediff(seconds, starttime, endtime)
  FROM stl_query 
  WHERE 
  querytxt LIKE '%Reporting%' 
  and starttime &gt;= '2018-04-15 00:00' 
  and endtime &lt; '2018-04-15 23:59';
</code></pre>
            
            <p>When you have associated a query with an evaluation category, you can use a unique
               identifier to determine throughput from the system tables for each category. </p>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Test throughput with historical user or ETL queries that have a variety of
               runtimes in your existing data warehouse. You might use a load testing utility, such
               as the open-source <a href="https://jmeter.apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>JMeter</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> or a custom
               utility. If so, make sure that your utility does the following:</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
                
                
            <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
                  <p>It can take the network transmission time into account. </p>
               </li><li class="listitem">
                  <p>It evaluates execution time based on throughput of the internal system
                     tables. For information about how to do this, see <a href="./c-analyzing-the-query-summary.html">Analyzing the query summary</a>. </p>
               </li></ul></div>

         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Identify all the various permutations that you plan to test during your

         </li><li class="listitem"><p>Reduce the cost of your proof of concept by pausing your cluster during off-hours and weekends.
            When a cluster is paused, on-demand compute billing is suspended. To run tests on the cluster, resume per-second 
            billing. You can also create a schedule to pause and resume your cluster automatically.
            For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-cluster-operations.html#rs-mgmt-pause-resume-cluster">Pausing and resuming clusters</a> in the <em>Amazon Redshift Management Guide</em>. </p>
